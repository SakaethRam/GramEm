# ZREX GramEm: AI-Powered Grammar and Sentiment Enhancement API

## **1. Introduction**  
GramEm is an advanced text processing API that corrects grammar and spelling errors while enhancing text with sentiment-based emoji suggestions. The system is designed for developers and businesses seeking an intelligent language enhancement tool that operates efficiently in an offline environment.

### **1.1 Purpose**  
The primary objectives of GramEm are:  
- To provide automated grammar and spelling correction using deep learning models.  
- To analyze sentiment in text and enhance user expression with appropriate emojis.  
- To operate without reliance on external blockchain infrastructure for full offline functionality.
